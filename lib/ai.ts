      1. Lead Time Check - Is the timeline feasible?
      2. Project Insight - Do we understand the requirements well?
      3. Client Relationship - How strong is our relationship with the client?
      4. Expertise Alignment - Do we have the necessary expertise?
      5. Commercial Viability - Is this opportunity financially viable?
      6. Strategic Value - Does this align with our strategic goals?
      7. Resources - Do we have the resources to deliver?
      
      For each criterion, provide:
      - A score (1-5)
      - A brief explanation for the score
      
      Then, provide an overall Go/No Go recommendation with your confidence level and reasoning.
